        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <h2>Reading the Visual</h2>
        <p>The visual is supposed to be an accurate representation of the target population. There are 100 icons, each representing
            a percentile of the population. Each icon is sized proportionaly to the average american income icon, provided
            on the visual page. An icon twice as large has an income twice as large. An income half as large has half the
            income. The order of the icons are randomized.
        </p>
        <h2>Calculations</h2>
        <p>This visual gets information from the Census's American Community Servey 2013-2017. The information provided from
            the survey is the number of households in a variety of income ranges, as well as the total number of households.
            This is used to calculate the percentile that an income at the cap of each of the ranges would be at, which in
            turn is then used to create a trapezoidal approximation of the percentile curve. However, the last range in the
            census information has no cap. For these percentiles, a regression curve is constructed from the last ten percentiles
            with known values.
