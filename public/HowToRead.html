        <h1>About the Visual</h1>
        <p>This visual is meant to convey information about income distributions in any city or zip code.</p>
        <h2>Reading the Visual</h2>
        <p>Once you search for a region, this text will be replaced with 100 scaled images, each representing the household
            income that each percentile of the population would earn. Images are scaled so that a 100px image represents
            the average American household income. Images are scaled proportionaly, to a household making twice that would
            be twice as large.
            <b class="orange">To get exact values, hover over an image once you search.</b>
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Average American Household Income</td>
                <td>1/2 Average American Household Income</td>
                <td>2x Average American Household Income</td>
                
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="/person.png" style="width:100px;height:100px;" class="green">
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="/person.png" style="width:50px;height:50px;" class="green">
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="/person.png" style="width:200px;height:200px;" class="green">
                </td>

        <h2>Searching</h2>
        <p>To search, just enter a 5-digit zip code or enter your city and state.</p>
        <p>Ex: 12345 or Somecity, Ca. Don't forget the comma!</p>
        <p>For most accurate results, <b class="purple">please use zip codes.</b>This is because data is currently gathered for only one zip code at a time, and cities can have multiple zip codes, and one is chosen more or less at random.</p>
